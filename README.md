# Autocomplete UI

## Folder name: auto-complete-ui

Create a simple autocomplete UI based on **your auto-complete** as an engine.

UI should contain input and results (in any suitable form suitable for you). The component should be rendered fully by JavaScript (document.body is empty).

You can add CSS styles as a separate file.

In auto-complete-ui folder, you **MUST** put a readme file with an instruction how to launch your app

Please define a project structure and (optionally) use patterns if they will be needed.

**Extra:** Infinite scroll

### Let's see my deploy on https://auto-complete-ui-spidervs.netlify.app/
