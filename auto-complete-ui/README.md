# Autocomplete UI App

## Prepare
1. Clone repository:

    **SSH**: `git@github.com:rolling-scopes-school/spidervs-ST2021Q3.git`

    **HTTPS**: `https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/spidervs-ST2021Q3.git`

2. Checkout to branch `auto-complete-ui`
3. Go to folder `auto-complete-ui`
4. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

## Run
There are two variants:
1. Run `npm run start` in the command line to start **webpack-dev-server** on `http://localhost:8080/`. If browser didn't start automatically, please type `http://localhost:8080/` to brouser's address string  and press `Enter`.

2. Run `npm run build` to build project in folder `dist`. You can go to folder `dist` and open `index.html` in VSCode extension **Live Server**.

## Notes
1. I recommend to use NodeJS of version **16 LTS** and latest Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox web browser.

Enjoy! :)
